      <p>This is my first ever blog page created and designed by me with the instructions given to me by my lecturer for this course. Dynamic Web Development has taught me different skills when it comes to HTML and CSS. I am better able to build navigate and even mantain webpages that i have started to create.</p>
      <p>I am excited to continue learning more and more about Web Development and what it has to offer as it will definitely be a great skill for one to have for future endeavours. Working with different Technological machines is very exciting to me and creating stuff like websites and webpages is pretty cool. I didnt know i would find it this intriguing.</p>

      <img src="/Users/kevonhaughton/Downloads/IMG_4561.PNG" alt="Second Blog Image" class="post-image" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; width: 150px; height: auto;">
      <p>I encourage anyone who is interested in learning to create webpages or websites to go ahead and learn the skill. You wont be dissapointed. It may seem a bit confusing at times but once you learn the basics you will definitely be interested to continue learning even more.</p>
      <p>Learning a skill like this can earn a person a great job at some high ranking corporations such as Google, Apple etc. Technology is taking over the world by storm so its good to use it and not let it use you. .</p>
